# Discord_chat_level_cheater
A python script to send random messages to level up in channels.

-This script also sends random messages to avoid bots that detect the user sending the same message.

-The words list is written in Arabic

-Sadly I used to remove the message after sending it but I removed this part because it's not reliable from a device to device 

Disclaimer: This script was used only with permission. I am not responsible for any misuse so use it at your own risk.





P.S: this project is made with the intention of just doing the job which is why it's not optimized nor documented probably.
